# Console-RPG
Just a small Java Project i'm writing to learn Java.




Console-RPG is a lightweight RPG that runs entirely on RAM and therefore can't save anything to a file (yet)

It is just a small project i write to deepen my understanding of Java and is therefore not to be taken entirely serious. 

If someone wants to add to it, just start another branch, thanks.
